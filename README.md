# MyNFT
This JavaScript program is a for the Metacrafters JavaScript Beginner's Asessment. The purpose of this program is to practice the basic components of JavaScript. Present in this program are the discussed topics in the Module 1 of the Metacrafters Beginner's Course in JavaScript.

## Description
This program is a simple creation of a sample NFT using JavaScript, a programming language that can be used for Web Development. The overall function of this program is to exercise the basics of JavaScript by making functions to create a simple NFT. The creation of this NFT can be done using the functions mintNFT(), stored in a variable called NFTs[] (array) and its details can be seen by using the function listNFTs(). The program must take inputs with the use of function calls and putting specific parameters on each function call. 

## Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you can use any IDE that can run JavaScript programs (Visual Studio Code, online JavaScript compilers (https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/), etc.). Copy and paste the code from the file "MyNFT.js".

Once the code is pasted on your IDE of choice, you may run the program immediately. In order to create your own NFT, you may create a function call of the function mintNFT() by writing:

``` mintNFT("your desired name of NFT", "your desired eye color", "your desired shirt type", "your desired bling"); ```

##### The code must be written below the last function call of mintNFT(). You may use the comments on the JavaScript program as a guide. 


After you have created your own NFT, you may run the program to see the details of NFTs created before and your latest addition to the list of NFTs.
